# SimpleJavaFileEncryption
Does what it promises: encrypts/decrypts whole files given a specified algorithm and mode.

I originally developed this program as part of my master's degree during my cryptology course.  It is able to take use any algorithm implemented in the SunJCE provider.  I'm assuming other providers could be implemented as well.
